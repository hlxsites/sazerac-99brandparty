## Form
Allows to track name, phone and email along with a note and send that content in an email. This form can only be used for this purpose, additional fields would need to be implemented additionally.
A special case is the locator form that uses a javascript function on button press.

the sharepoint spreadsheet defines the fields available and the redirect after the form is sent. Adding new fileds, however, needs additional changes in the sendmail function.
